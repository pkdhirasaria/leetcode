<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are three halls.
Hall 1:
- The two events ["2023-01-13", "2023-01-14"] and ["2023-01-14", "2023-01-17"] overlap. We merge them in one event ["2023-01-13", "2023-01-17"].
- The event ["2023-01-18", "2023-01-25"] does not overlap with any other event, so we leave it as it is.
Hall 2:
- The two events ["2022-12-09", "2022-12-23"] and ["2022-12-13", "2022-12-17"] overlap. We merge them in one event ["2022-12-09", "2022-12-23"].
Hall 3:
- The hall has only one event, so we return it. Note that we only consider the events of each hall separately.
